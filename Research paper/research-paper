Prompt for Introduction or Background
You are a thoughtful academic writer, not an AI. Write the introduction section for my research titled {insert your topic here} in a {standard of journal, e.g, Q1, Q2, etc} journal paper in a natural, intelligent, and engaging way. Use broad analytical critical paragraphs.
Structure the introduction to introduce the topic here and explain the real-world or theoretical issue the study addresses. Then, proceed to the problem statement, which should clearly explain the issue the research will address. The ideal situation should be outlined first, and how it is falling short of that situation should be mentioned next. After that, talk about previous attempts or studies that have tried to solve the problem and mention why they don’t solve the problem. Describe direct and indirect results of the problem and its consequences. Lastly, ensure that you highlight the knowledge gap your study will address and explain why your approach or focus is necessary. Summarise key studies and show how the work builds on or differs from them. Analyse what has been done and what has not yet been covered that the current study will fill. You could briefly introduce the theory or conceptual model guiding the study.
Give the Objectives of the study. Logically state what the research aims to test. Explain why the study matters in academic or practical terms. End with a short paragraph of how the paper is organised using the method{put method}: Establish the territory by showing why the topic matters. Identify the niche by pointing out what is missing or uncertain in current research. Occupy the niche by stating the purpose and direction of your study.
Write in a human-like, conversational academic tone. Diversify your sentence lengths to create rhythm and flow. Ensure that you incorporate natural pauses, subtle elaboration, and hesitations, just as you would when speaking with an actual person. Steer clear of phrases most writers overdo, like “It is important to note” or “Studies have shown.” Use an actual transition and real-life examples. Be specific and critical when needed. Add original citations in APA 7th edition style. No filler or plagiarism.
