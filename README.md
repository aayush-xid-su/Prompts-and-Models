# Prompts and Models

A curated collection of **system prompts, model configurations, agent instructions, utilities, examples, and integrations** for a range of AI tools and frameworks — designed to support prompt engineering, research, and AI-assisted workflows.

This repository provides examples, standardized prompt formats, and structured model usage patterns to help developers build more predictable, explainable, and powerful AI applications.

---

## 📌 Overview

Modern AI tools rely heavily on *system prompts* and *instruction engineering* to shape behavior. This project gathers prompts, model templates, agent definitions, and integration examples in one place to:

- 💡 Demonstrate how major AI systems are instructed under the hood
- 🚀 Provide reusable prompt patterns
- 🛠 Facilitate experimentation with different model prompts and workflows
- 📚 Serve as a learning resource for prompt engineering
